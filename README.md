# Numerical-PDEs-In-ChE
Welcome to **Numerical-PDEs-In-ChE** — a growing collection of Python-powered solutions to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in Chemical Engineering! From heat flow in a rod to reaction-diffusion in a reactor, this repo brings numerical methods to life with practical, hands-on examples. Whether you're a student, researcher, or engineer, dive in to explore, learn, or even contribute!

## Why This Repo?
PDEs are the backbone of chemical engineering processes, and solving them numerically is a superpower. This repo is here to:
- Break down complex problems into understandable code.
- Provide reusable templates for your own projects.
- Bridge theory and practice with real-world applications.

## What's Inside?
This repo organizes PDE problems into clear categories, each targeting a key area of chemical engineering. Here’s what we have (and what’s coming):

- **`heat_and_mass_transfer`**: Models heat and mass transport phenomena.  
  - *Problem 1*: Temperature evolution in a 1-meter rod with fixed boundary conditions.  
  - *Problem 2*: 2D heat transfer in a square plate with heat flux and insulated boundaries.

- **`reaction_diffusion`**: Explores systems with chemical reactions and diffusion.  
  - *Problem 1*: 1D simulation of mass and heat transfer with a temperature-dependent reaction.

- **`fluid_dynamics`**: Investigates fluid flow and dynamics in chemical engineering systems.  
  - *Problem 1*: 1D laminar flow between parallel plates under a constant pressure gradient.  
  - *Problem 2*: Two-phase flow pressure drop in a vertical pipe using the homogeneous model.
  
- **`reactor_design_and_kinetics`**: Focuses on reactor modeling and reaction kinetics (coming soon!).  
  - *Problem 1*: TBD — stay tuned!

- **`process_design_and_simulation`**: Covers large-scale process simulations (coming soon!).  
  - *Problem 1*: TBD — stay tuned!

- **`misc_and_advanced_topics`**: Catches unique or advanced PDE challenges (coming soon!).  
  - *Problem 1*: TBD — stay tuned!

More problems and categories will be added over time — think of this as a living toolbox for ChE PDEs!
