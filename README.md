# Numerical-PDEs-In-ChE
This repository provides Python-based solutions to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) commonly encountered in Chemical Engineering. It focuses on applying numerical methods to solve problems such as heat transfer, mass transport, and reaction-diffusion. The collection will grow with more problems and solutions over time.
