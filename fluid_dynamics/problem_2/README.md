# Problem 2: Two-Phase Flow Pressure Drop in a Vertical Pipe

Calculate the pressure drop in a vertical upward two-phase flow (air-water) through a pipe using the homogeneous flow model.

## Specifications
- Pipe diameter: 20 mm
- Pipe length: 1.3 m
- Liquid flow rate (water): 0.4 kg/s
- Gas flow rate (air): 0.008 kg/s
- Temperature: 20Â°C
- Outlet pressure: 1 bar

## Methodology
- Uses homogeneous flow model
- Colebrook-White equation for friction factor
- Numerical integration along pipe length
- Accounts for frictional, static head, and gas compressibility effects
